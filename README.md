# RCTruck
Python program using Wiimote to control Raspberry Pi with Adafruit HAT in RCTruck 

I set up this program based on some example code for Wiimote and the example code from Adafruit Learning.
It's meant to control a RC Truck with the Wiimote. The Adafruit DC and Stepper motor HAT is used to control the motors.
The program starts simple, I will add on more features and more sophistication later on.
The project is multi-purpose:
- Learn Python on Raspberry Pi
- Learn to use GPIO and Adafruit to connect to real world
- Learn to use Wiimote as controller

Anyone can copy/use or extend this code, just bear in mind it is very bare bone, so bear with me
